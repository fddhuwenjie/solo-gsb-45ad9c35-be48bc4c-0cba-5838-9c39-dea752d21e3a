"""Durable per-session storage for batched operation submission.

A session pins the shared initial document and initial version vector and
accumulates every accepted batch into one cumulative operation log.  Both
reads and batch commits re-run the ordinary merge rules *from the initial
document* over the whole log -- the previous result is never used as a new
baseline -- so late-arriving concurrent writes still take part in the
original arbitration and conflict accounting, and a batch may causally
reference operations stored by earlier batches.

Every commit that contributes new operations also appends an immutable
**history boundary**: the merged document at the new revision.  Boundary
``h`` is the document of revision ``h``, so the events of revision ``r``
are the snapshot diff from boundary ``r-1`` to boundary ``r`` -- exactly
what ``POST /route-changes`` would compute between the two documents.
Boundaries are persisted in the same atomic write as the revision (inside
the same cross-process locked section), so an incremental reader can page
through committed revisions after a restart.  Retransmissions, stale
``expected_revision`` submissions and invalid batches add no history.

Late-arriving concurrent edits change the *current* merge result but can
never rewrite a previously committed boundary: a boundary stores the
document snapshot that was current at commit time, not a pointer into a
later recomputation.

Sessions written by older versions of the service have no history
boundaries.  On the first access (any read, or the first successful
commit) of such a legacy record the boundary history is seeded with one
entry: the currently visible merged document at the session's current
revision.  That revision becomes the session's history origin: cursors
before it, or past the current revision, are rejected (422 at the HTTP
layer).

Batch commits are atomic: validation, recomputation and the revision bump
happen inside a critical section guarded by an in-process lock *and* a
per-session ``flock`` file (``.{session_id}.lock`` next to the session
file), and the record is re-read from disk inside that section.  The
guarantee therefore holds not only between threads of one process but
also between several service processes sharing ``SESSION_STORE_DIR``:
two concurrent submissions carrying the same expected revision cannot
both succeed -- the loser observes the bumped revision and gets a
conflict.  The updated session is written to disk (temp file +
``os.replace``) before the lock is released, and reads always come
straight from disk (never from a per-process cache), so every process
immediately sees the latest committed revision.

Sessions are persisted as one JSON file per session inside a directory
(``SESSION_STORE_DIR`` env var, default ``.sessions``), so they remain
readable after the service (or ``docker compose``) restarts.  The lock
files are never deleted -- they are tiny, their number is bounded by the
number of sessions, and deleting them would reintroduce an
unlink/reopen race.
